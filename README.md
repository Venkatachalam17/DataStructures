# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository documents my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** step by step, with a strong focus on **problem-solving and interview preparation**.

I am starting from the **basics** and gradually moving towards advanced topics, making sure my foundations are solid.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Build strong fundamentals in DSA
- Practice problem-solving in a structured way
- Prepare for **college technical interviews**
- Track my learning progress consistently

---

## 🧠 Current Focus

### ✅ Arrays
I am currently learning **Arrays**, covering:
- Basic array operations
- Traversal techniques
- Searching elements
- Understanding time & space complexity
- Using loops (`for`, `for-each`)
- Building problem-solving logic

Arrays form the foundation of DSA, and mastering them helps in understanding advanced topics like hashing, two pointers, and sliding window.
